> ... to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern,
> resource-efficient and competitive economy where there are no net emissions
> of greenhouse gases in **2050** and where economic growth is **decoupled from
> resource use** [...] To reach these objectives, "energy efficiency must be prioritised".

## It's simple

> Energy efficiency simply means using less energy to perform the same task –
> that is, eliminating energy waste. --

Many papers and whitepapers discussing EE:

## Anecdata

> We replaced a previous service with a Go implementation and we require 1/8 of the resources.

> Previously, we needed two servers, now we one is more than enough.
