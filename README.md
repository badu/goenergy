## It's simple

> that is, eliminating energy waste. --

Many papers and whitepapers discussing EE:

* [Digitalization and energy consumption. Does ICT reduce energy demand?](https://fatcat.wiki/release/27wghdxkvvg5lfzk3vqs7vpxp4) (2020, cited [by 50+](https://fatcat.wiki/release/27wghdxkvvg5lfzk3vqs7vpxp4/refs-in))

## Anecdata

> Previously, we needed two servers, now we one is more than enough.

> We replaced a previous service with a Go implementation and we require 1/8 of the resources.

Personally:

* "big data on a budget" projects, processing TBs w/o a cluster

## Paper

> [Ranking Programming Languages by Energy Efficiency](https://haslab.github.io/SAFER/scp21.pdf)

* 10 tasks (n-body, mandelbrot, binary-trees, ...), 27 languages (functional, OO, imp, scripting)

> While the concern on the computers' energy efficiency started by the hardware
> manufacturers, it quickly became a concern for software developers too [...]

Using [RAPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_(Linux)#RAPL), [LWN545745](https://lwn.net/Articles/545745/) - to collect energy measurements.

Some tools (on Ubuntu): powertop, powercap-utils, ...

```shell
$ cat /boot/config-$(uname -r) | grep RAPL
CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS_INTEL_RAPL=m
CONFIG_PROC_THERMAL_MMIO_RAPL=m
CONFIG_INTEL_RAPL_CORE=m
CONFIG_INTEL_RAPL=m
```

Powertop seems to work w/o RAPL, too.

> RAPL support allows PowerTOP to provide more accurate power measurements. -- [01/powertop](https://01.org/sites/default/files/page/powertop_users_guide_201412.pdf#page=6)

Method: [system](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/system.3.html) syscall running program, measure via RAPL

## Selected results

| Benchmark      | Position (Go) |
|----------------|---------------|
| binary-tree    | 20/27         |
| fannkuch-redux | 11/27         |
| fasta          | 7/27          |

Normalized - Go at **14/27** - **consuming 3.23x more** than the most efficient
language (C) and only **4-5%** compared to the least efficient languages (Perl,
Python).

| Type        | Consumption (J)|
|-------------|----------------|
| Compiled    | 120            |
| VM          | 576            |
| Interpreted | 2365           |

By paradigm:

| Type       | Consumption (J) |
|------------|-----------------|
| Imperative | 125             |
| OO         | 879             |
| Functional | 1367            |
| Scripting  | 2320            |

## Where Go shines

Category: Lowest peak memory usage.

> The top 5 languages, also presented in Table 4, with the lowest value were: Pascal (66 Mb), Go (69 Mb), C (77 Mb), Fortran (82 Mb), and C++ (88 Mb);

Also in multi-objective ranking:

![](scp21-tab7.png)

> In Table 7 we present four multi-objective rankings: time & memory, energy
& time, energy & memory, and energy & time, & memory. For each ranking, each
line represents a Pareto optimal set, or in other words the Pareto front, that
is, a set containing the languages that are equivalent to each other for the
underlying objectives. Simply put, **each line is a single rank or position**.


> The most common performance characteristics of software languages used to
evaluate and choose them are execution time and memory usage. If we consider
these two characteristics in our evaluation, C, Pascal, and Go are equivalent.

Extraordinaire, cette coincidence: Thompson (Bell Labs, C) and Griesemer
(Wirth) are among the designers of Go.

There, Go seems to do a bit better.

Overall, Go holds its ground in this benchmark - and since we even have
[Generics](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18#generics) since a few months ...
